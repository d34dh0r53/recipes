Garlic Bread Pizza
==================

In a large bowl, combine, then let sit until foamy, about 10 minutes:

- 1-1/8 cups warm water (100-105 degrees)
- 3 teaspoons active dry yeast
- 1-1/2 tablespoons honey
- 1-1/2 tablespoon olive oil

Add, stirring with a spoon until the dough comes together but it still sticky:

- 2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon dried basil

Using your hands, form the dough into a ball and work the additional 1/2 cup
flour (you donâ€™t need to use all if it is not needed) in to the dough, kneading
it on a floured surface for a few minutes.

- 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

Rub the same bowl with olive oil then place the dough inside, turning to coat.

Cover with a towel and place in a warm place to rise for about 1 1/2 hours.

Preheat oven to 500 degrees F.

After the dough has risen, punch it down and place it back on the floured
surface. Using a roll pin or your hands, form it into your desired shape
(sometimes I use baking sheets and do rectangles or free form pizzas). Place
the towel back over the dough and let sit in the warm place for 10 minutes.

In a seperate bowl, combine to form a garlic mixture:

- 3 tablespoons butter, melted
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tablespoon parmesan cheese

Bring the dough back out and using a spoon or pastry brush, douse the outside
edges with the parmesean mixture.

Top pizza as desired.

Bake the pizza until golden brown, about 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a separate bowl, combine:

- 1 tablespoons butter, melted
- 1 tablespoon parmesan cheese

When pizza is ready, immediately brush outsides of crust once more with
additional parmesean mixture.
