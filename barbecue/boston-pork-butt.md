Boston pork butt
================

- Wood: Oak
- Smoker temperature: 275 F
- Final internal temperature: 200 F
- Rested temperature: 175 F (arbitrary)
- Cook time:
  - 5 pounds took 7 hours @ 275 F (total time: 10 hours)
  - 9 pounds took 9.5 hours @ 275 F (total time: 11.5 hours), however I split this one in half 2.5 hours into the cook (!) to accelerate it. Cutting it in half is not a bad idea, but cutting it in half when half the bark has already formed might have contributed to some loss in moisture and very weak bark on the newly exposed meat.
