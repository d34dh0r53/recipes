Boston pork butt
================

- Wood: Oak
- Smoker temperature: 275 F
- Final internal temperature: 200 F
- Rested temperature: 175 F (arbitrary)
- Wrap: optional, anytime after bark has formed.
- Cook time:
  - 5 pounds unwrapped took 7 hours (total time: 10 hours)
  - 9 pounds wrapped at 8 hours took 9.5 hours (total time: 11.5 hours), however I split this one in half 2.5 hours into the cook (!) to accelerate it. Cutting it in half is not a bad idea, but cutting it in half when half the bark has already formed might have contributed to some loss in moisture and very weak bark on the newly exposed meat.
  - 5.5 pounds unwrapped took [on at 4:45am]
