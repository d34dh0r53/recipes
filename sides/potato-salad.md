Potato salad
============

Potatoes
--------

Place the potatoes and 2 tablespoons of salt in a large pot of water. Bring the water to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, until the potatoes are barely tender when pierced with a knife.

- 3 pounds small white potatoes
- 2 tablespoons Kosher salt

Drain the potatoes in a colander, then place the colander with the potatoes over the empty pot and cover with a clean, dry kitchen towel. Allow the potatoes to steam for 15 to 20 minutes.

Dressing
--------

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together and set aside:

- 1 cup mayonnaise
- 1/4 cup buttermilk
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard
- 1/2 cup chopped fresh dill
- 1 teaspoon Kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Combine
-------

When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut them down to bite size and place them in a large bowl. While the potatoes are still warm, pour enough dressing over them to moisten. Add:

- 1/2 cup chopped celery
- 1/2 cup chopped red onion
- 2 teaspoon Kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Toss well, cover, and refrigerate for a few hours to allow the flavors to blend.

Serve cold or at room temperature.
