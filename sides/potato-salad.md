Potato salad
============

Potatoes
--------

Place the potatoes and 2 tablespoons of salt in a large pot of water. Bring the water to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, until the potatoes are barely tender when pierced with a knife.

- 3 pounds small white potatoes
- 2 tablespoons Kosher salt

Drain the potatoes in a colander, then place the colander with the potatoes over the empty pot and cover with a clean, dry kitchen towel. Allow the potatoes to steam for 15 to 20 minutes.

Dressing
--------

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together and set aside:

- 220 grams (~1 cup) mayonnaise
- 60 grams (~1/4 cup) buttermilk
- 2 tablespoons Colman's mustard powder
- 6 grams (1/2 cup) fresh dill, chopped
- 1 teaspoon Kosher salt
- 2 grams (~1 teaspoon) freshly ground black pepper

Marinate
--------

When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut them down to bite size and place them in a large bowl. While the potatoes are still warm, pour enough dressing over them to moisten. Add:

- 2 ribs (~1/2 cup) chopped celery
- 1/2 cup chopped red onion
- 2 teaspoon Kosher salt
- 2 grams (~1 teaspoon) freshly ground black pepper

Toss well, cover, and refrigerate for a few hours to allow the flavors to blend.
