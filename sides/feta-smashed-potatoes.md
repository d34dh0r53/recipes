Feta smashed potatoes
=====================

In a 4-quart saucepan, cover with cold salted water:

- 2 pound red or Russet potatoes, quartered

Bring to a boil then simmer until the tines of a fork slide easily into the
potatoes (about 15 minutes). Drain.

In a 4-quart saucepan, melt over medium heat:

- 1/3 cup heavy cream
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter

Remove the saucepan from the heat.

Add the potatoes, and roughly smash them into the hot cream mixture. Fold in:

- 10 chives, finely chopped

Season to taste:

- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
