Brussels sprouts
================

Pour enough oil into a medium pot so that the oil comes 3 inches up the sides.
Heat the oil to 350 degrees.

- Canola oil, for deep-frying

Whisk together in a bowl large enough to toss all of the Brussels sprouts:

- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 4 salt-packed anchovy fillets, rinsed, filleted and minced
- 1 serrano chile, seeded and minced
- 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 2 scallions, white and green parts, thinly sliced on the bias
- 1/2 cup walnut pieces, toasted and coarsely chopped
- 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil

Working in batches, deep-fry the Brussels sprouts until the edges begin to curl
and brown, about 3 minutes.

- 1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and quartered lengthwise

To the last batch, add and stand back (the capers will pop and sputter!):

- 2 cups loosely packed flat-leaf parsley leaves
- 2 tablespoons salt-packed capers, rinsed and patted dry

When the color of the parsley becomes a deeper, more saturated shade of green,
about 30 seconds to 1 minute, remove the contents of the pot with a skimmer and
place directly in the bowl of dressing. Toss to coat. Season to taste.

- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
