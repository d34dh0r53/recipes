Sushi rice
==========

Rinse until the water runs clear:

- 2 cups sushi rice

Place the rice and water into a medium saucepan and bring to a boil:

- 2 cups water

Once it begins to boil, reduce the heat to the lowest setting and cover.
Cook for 15 minutes.
Remove from the heat and let stand, covered, for 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, combine in a small bowl and heat in the microwave on high for 30 to 45 seconds:

- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 (to 3?) teaspoon kosher salt

Transfer the rice into a glass mixing bowl and add the vinegar mixture.
Fan the rice while folding thoroughly to combine.
Allow to cool to room temperature before using.
