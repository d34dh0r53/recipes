Chicken and dumplings
=====================

Season and dredge both sides:

- 3 pounds chicken thighs
- Salt and pepper
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour

In two batches, brown chicken on both sides and remove to a clean plate:

- Chicken
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

In the same pot, saute over medium-low heat (about 3-4 minutes):

- 1/2 cup carrots, diced
- 1/2 cup celery, diced
- 1 whole medium onion, diced

Add to combine, cover and simmer for 20 minutes:

- 1/2 teaspoon ground thyme
- 1/4 teaspoon turmeric
- 6 cups low sodium chicken broth
- 1/2 cup apple cider

While chicken is simmering, make the dough for the dumplings by sifting together all dry ingredients, then add half-and-half, stirring gently to combine. Set aside.

- 1-1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup yellow cornmeal
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 1/2 cup half-and-half

Remove chicken from pot and shred it. Add to combine, then simmer for 15 minutes:

- Shredded chicken
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- Dumpling dough, roughly formed into tablespoon-sized balls
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, minced
- Kosher salt

Allow to sit for 10 minutes before serving.
