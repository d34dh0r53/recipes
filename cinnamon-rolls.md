Cinnamon Rolls
==============

Dough
-----

Warm the milk in a medium saucepan over low heat until it reaches about 100F.

- 1 cup whole milk

Remove from the heat and sprinkle in the yeast and 1/4 teaspoon sugar (don't
stir). Set aside until foamy, 5 minutes.

- one 1/4-ounce packet active dry yeast (2.5 teaspoons)
- 1/4 teaspoon granulated sugar

Whisk in the melted butter, egg yolk and vanilla.

- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for the bowl
- 1 large egg yolk
- 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Whisk the flour, the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, the salt and nutmeg in the bowl
of a stand mixer.

- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more if needed
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg

Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture. Mix on low speed with
the dough hook until thick and slightly sticky. Knead on medium speed until the
dough gathers around the hook, 6 minutes. (Add up to 2 more tablespoons flour
if necessary.)

Remove the dough and shape into a ball. Butter the mixer bowl and return the
dough to the bowl, turning to coat with butter. Cover with plastic wrap and let
rise until doubled, 1 hour 15 minutes.

Filling
-------

Combine:

- All-purpose flour, for dusting
- 12 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, plus more for the pan
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 3 tablespoons ground cinnamon

Rolls
-----

Roll out the dough, fill and cut into buns (see instructions below). Butter a
9-by-13-inch baking pan; place the buns cut-side down in the pan, leaving space
between each. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, 40 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 325.

Bake the buns until golden brown, about 35 minutes. Cool in the pan 15 minutes.

1. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 12-by-14-inch rectangle
with the longer side facing you.

2. Spread with the softened butter, leaving a 1/2-inch border on the far long
edge. Mix the sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over the butter.

3. Brush the unbuttered far edge with water. Roll the dough away from you into
a tight cylinder and press on the long edge to seal.

4. Cut the cylinder with a sharp knife to make 6 equal-size buns.

Glaze
-----

Sift the confectioners' sugar into a bowl, then whisk in the cream and melted
butter. Transfer the buns to a rack and spoon the glaze on top while still
warm.

- 2 cups confectioners' sugar
- 1/3 cup heavy cream
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
