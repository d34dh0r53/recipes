Dry chicken and season.

Peel, devein, and season shrimp.

- 1 pound large shrimp (10-25 per pound), peeled and deveined

Heat 15 inch cast iron skillet or dutch oven until smoking:

- 2 teaspoons canola oil

Cook chicken, skin-side down first, until both sides are golden.

Transfer chicken to a plate, and discard skin (no need to keep warm).

Leave 2 teaspoons of fat in skillet. Brown over medium-high heat:

Add the liquids, and bring to a simmer.

- 14.5 ounce can diced tomatoes, drained

- 2.5 cups low sodium chicken broth

Return the chicken to the pot, nestling it into the water. Cook until the chicken is cooked through (about 30 minutes).

- Partially-cooked chicken

Transfer chicken to a plate, and keep warm. Shred into bite size pieces when convenient.

Stir the shrimp and sausage into the rice, cover, and cook over low heat for 3 minutes.
