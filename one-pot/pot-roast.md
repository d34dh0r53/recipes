Pot roast
=========

Heat a dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sear on all sides:

- 2-3 lbs whole chuck roast, seasoned
- 2 tablespoons butter

Remove and set aside the meat. Using the remaining fat, sweat:

- 4 carrots, chopped
- 2 medium yellow onions, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced

Deglaze the pot with:

- 2 cups red wine

Return the roast to the pot and add:

- 3 cups beef stock
- 3 gold potatoes, chopped
- 3 sprigs fresh thyme
- 3 sprigs fresh rosemary

Simmer on low heat until the meat is falling apart (about 3 hours). When nearly
ready, make a medium roux in a separate pan, then combine with the pot roast:

- 3 tablespoons flour
- 2 tablespoons butter
