Skillet roasted chicken
=======================

Preheat oven to 450 F, and place a skillet in the oven.

> The chicken needs to be salted heavier than normal in order to stand up to
  the acid introduced later.

When the oven is preheated, reduce the oven to 400 F, transfer the skillet to
the stove over medium-high heat, and sear, skin-side down, until the skins are
browned:

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- Chicken pieces (4 thighs, or two split breasts), bone-in, skin-on, heavily
  seasoned with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

Flip chicken over, and transfer skillet to oven. Bake until chicken is cooked.

> Now is a good time to add hearty, seasoned vegetables to roast with the
  chicken, such as Brussels sprouts, carrots, or potatoes.

When the chicken is done, transfer the skillet back to the stove, set the
chicken aside to rest, and discard all but 1 tablespoon of the remaining fat in
the pan. Add:

- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 large garlic clove, minced
- 1 teaspoon fresh Thyme, minced

When the garlic begins to brown, add:

- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

Pour the pan sauce over the chicken and serve immediately.
