=================

Preheat oven to 300 F, with an oven rack in the lower-middle position.

Season:

- 8 bone-in, skin-on **chicken thighs**, trimmed
- Kosher salt

In a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, sear both sides, working in batches:

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- Chicken

Set chicken aside.

Discard all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the pot.

Over medium heat, soften until browned:

- 1 small **onion**, minced

Add, and cook until fragrant:

- 6 medium **garlic** cloves, minced (about 2 tablespoons)

Submerge, bring to a simmer, and transfer to oven until chicken begins to fall off the bone (~75 minutes):

Remove from the oven, transfer the chicken to a serving platter (or plates) and tent loosely.

Discard the bay leaf.

Stir in:

- 1 teaspoon grated zest from 1 **lemon**

Set the pot over high heat, bring to a boil, and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened and reduced to 2 cups, about 5 minutes.
