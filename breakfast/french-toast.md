French toast
============

> Serves 3.

Preheat the oven to 300 F with an oven rack in the middle position.

Bake on a wire reck over a rimmed baking sheet, until almost dry (~16 minutes), flipping halfway:

- 6 pieces **Challah** or **Brioche** (or any hearty white sandwich bread), sliced 3/4" thick

Cool bread for 5 minutes.

Return empty rack and baking sheet to the oven, reducing the temperature to 200 F.

In a large bowl, whisk together:

- 1.5 cups **whole milk**, warmed
- 3 large **egg** yolks
- 3 tablespoons **light brown sugar**
- 1/2 teaspoon **ground cinnamon**
- 1/2 teaspoon **ground nutmeg**
- 2 tablespoons **unsalted butter**, melted
- 1 tablespoon **vanilla extract**
- 1/4 teaspoon table salt

Transfer mixture to a 13x9 baking pan.

Soak the bread in the milk mixture until saturated, but not falling apart (~20 seconds).
Using a slotted spatula, drain excess mixture, and transfer slices to a second baking sheet.

Heat in a 12-inch skillet of medium-low heat until foaming subsides:

- 1/2 tablespoon **unsalted butter**

Cook two slices at a time, and cook until golden brown (~3 minutes per side). Reduce heat if they're browning any faster.

Transfer cooked sliced to the baking sheet in the oven.

Wipe skillet with paper towels, re-butter the skillet, and repeat with remaining slices.

Serve with:

- Protein (grilled ham, crispy bacon, etc)
- Mixed fruit w/ lime juice & lime zest for extra tartness
- Herbaceous, salty hash browns
- **Maple syrup**
- Powdered sugar
