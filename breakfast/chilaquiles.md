- 3 corn tortillas

Slice the tortillas into strips (approximately 1cm x 2cm).

In a skillet, fry until slightly browned:

- 2 tablespoons canola oil

Remove tortilla strips when well browned. Dry over a paper towel, and season with kosher salt.

In the same pan, adding extra oil if necessary, lightly brown:

When ham is nearly ready, add and saute until translucent:

- 2 tablespoons yellow onions, diced

Transfer to a non-stick pan:

- Ham and onions
- 2 heaping tablespoons chunky salsa (such as Mark's Good Stuff)

Cook over medium heat until salsa just begins to dry up. Add and lower heat:

- 6 eggs, beaten

When eggs are nearly cooked, add and fold together:

- 1 heaping tablespoon chunky salsa
- Tortilla strips
- 2 ounces sharp cheddar, chopped

Plate immediately, and garnish each serving with:

- 1 heaping tablespoon chunky salsa
