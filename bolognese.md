Bolognese
=========

In a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, saute until the onions are just short of caramelized (about 10-15 minutes):

- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 1 carrot, finely diced
- 1 rib celery, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- Kosher salt & freshly ground black pepper

Increase heat to high and cook until the meat is well browned (about 5-10 minutes):

- 1 pound lamb, ground
- 1/2 pound veal, ground
- 1/4 pound pancetta, ground

Reduce heat to low and simmer for 2-2.5 hours with a lid slightly ajar:

- 1 large tomato, seeded and diced
- 1 cup milk
- 1.5 cup dry red (or white?) wine
- 2.5 oz tomato paste
- Bouquet garni of rosemary, thyme, sage, parsley

Discard bouquet garni. Remove from heat. Season sauce to tasete, toss to coat with pasta, and garnish:

- Kosher salt & freshly ground black pepper
- 1 pound fresh tri color fettuccine pasta, cooked
- Parmigiano-reggiano
- Parsley, minced
