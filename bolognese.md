Bolognese
=========

In a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, saute until the onions are just short of caramelized (about 10-15 minutes):

- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 2 medium onions, diced
- 2 carrots, finely diced
- 4 ribs celery, diced
- 5 cloves garlic, minced
- Kosher salt & freshly ground black pepper

Increase heat to high and render the fat:

- 4 ounces pancetta, finely minced or ground

Cook until the meat is well browned (about 5-10 minutes):

- 1 pound lamb, ground
- 8 ounces veal, ground

Reduce heat to low and simmer for 2-2.5 hours with a lid slightly ajar:

- 1 large tomato, seeded and diced
- 1.5 cups chicken stock
- 1.5 cups dry red wine
- 4.5 ounces tomato paste
- Bouquet garni of rosemary, thyme, sage, parsley

Discard bouquet garni. Remove from heat. Season sauce to taste, toss to coat with pasta:

- Kosher salt & freshly ground black pepper
- 1 pound pappardelle pasta (or any wide pasta), cooked
- Reserved pasta water, as necessary

Garnish and serve immediately:

- Parmigiano-reggiano, thinly sliced or grated
- Fresh parsley, minced
