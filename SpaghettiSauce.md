# Dave's Spaghetti Sauce
**Apologies to Italian's everywhere**

## Ingredients
* [ ] 3 lb ground meat (beef, turkey, pork) mixed
* [ ] 1 Large onion diced
* [ ] 2 Carrots diced
* [ ] 2 Celery stalks diced
* [ ] 4 cloves garlic minced
* [ ] 1-3 28Oz can San Marzano tomatos
* [ ] 2 jars premade spaghetti sauce (optional)
* [ ] 2 tbsp high quality tomato paste (get the stuff in a tube)
* [ ] 1 tbsp dried oregano
* [ ] 1 cup red wine
* [ ] 1 tbsp potato starch (optional)
* [ ] 1 tbsp sugar
* [ ] 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
* [ ] Olive oil

## Directions
This is best done in an enameled cast iron pot or dutch oven preheated over
medium high heat.

Brown meat in batches extremely well, you want a nice fond on the bottom of the
pot, this means cooking off all of the liquid allowing the meat to obtain a
nice crust. I usually add salt at this stage to season the meat. Once the meat
has a nice crust remove from pot.

Lower heat to medium/medium low and add some oil if the meat was not very
fatty.  Then add the carrots, celery and onions a pinch of salt and sweat until
they have released most of their juices and the fond starts forming again.  As
the vegetables are finishing add the garlic and the oregano and cook for a
minute, then add the tomato paste and cook until it starts to stick to the
bottom of the pot.

Deglaze with red wine, and scrape very well. The fond may look quite dark but
this is okay, it tastes delicious. Once the wine has reduced re-add meat, and
San Marzano tomatos, break up the tomatos with your spatula.  Cook for a
minute.

Add jars of premade sauce and bring to a simmer. These are optional, for a more
wholesome, less processed sauce you can just use additional cans of San
Marzano tomatos. If you do just use cans of tomatos you may want to add some
additional herbage of your choosting, and you'll probably need more sugar as
jars of sauce are rather sweet.

Simmer covered for 2-4 hours stirring occasionally. Enjoy over aldente pene,
ziti or...spaghetti. Spaghetti are not the best noodles for this dish as their
shape is not condusive to the adhesion of a thick meaty sauce. This is more of
a Bolognese sauce and is better suited to a hollow, more robust noodle.

Towards the end I add the potato starch very carefully to the sauce and stir
ensuring that there are no lumps.  This tightens up the sauce a bit, I don't
like watery spaghetti sauce so this step can be considered optional. At this
point I also start tasting for seasoning, adding about half of the sugar and
balsamic, letting it cook for a minute or so and then tasting again.

## Notes
I find that this sauce is all about the fond, you really want a nice thick fond
on the bottom of the pot when the meat, veggies and tomato paste are done, this
layer will greatly influence the richness and heartiness of the sauce. Don't
speed through the meat browning as that is where most of the fond will come
from.
