Mashed potatoes
===============

In a 4-quart saucepan, cover with cold salted water:

- 2.5 pounds russet potatoes, peeled, coarsely chopped

Bring to a boil then simmer until the tines of a fork slide easily into the
potatoes, 15â€“20 minutes. Drain.

In a 4-quart saucepan, melt over medium heat:

- 1.5 cups heavy cream
- 8 tablespoons unsalted butter

Remove the saucepan from the heat.

Working in batches, pass the potatoes through a ricer into the hot cream
mixture.

Beat the potatoes vigorously with a whisk until smooth and creamy. Season with
salt and pepper, to taste.

- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
