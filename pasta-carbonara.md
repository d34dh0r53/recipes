Pasta carbonara
===============

Whisk in a small bowl:

- 2 large egg yolks, room temperature
- 30 grams grated pecorino Romano (or Parmesan, or a blend)
- Coarsely ground black pepper

In a pan over medium-low heat, gently saute until slightly crispy:

- 1/2 tablespoon olive oil
- 50 grams pancetta, sliced into 1/4" cubes

Toss to coat and remove from the heat:

- 170 grams spaghetti (or fettucini, or linguine), cooked al dente
- 1/4 cup pasta water

When it has cooled enough to not scramble the eggs, coat with:

- Egg & cheese mixture

Garnish and serve immediately:

- Parmesan
- Black pepper
- Parsley, optional
