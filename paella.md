Paella
======

Heat the oven to 400°F and arrange a rack in the middle.

Core and halve the tomatoes. Grate the flesh side of each half on the large
holes of a box grater set over a medium bowl, stopping when you get to the
skin. Discard the skins. You should have about 3/4 cup of tomato pulp and
juice; set aside.

- 2 medium, ripe tomatoes (about 12 ounces)

Place the shrimp in a medium bowl, add 1/4 teaspoon of the paprika, and season
with salt and pepper. Toss to combine and refrigerate.

- 16 large shrimp (about 12 ounces), peeled and deveined
- 1/4 teaspoon smoked Spanish paprika (pimentón dulce)
- Freshly ground black pepper

Place the chicken in a medium bowl and season generously with salt and pepper;
set aside.

- 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces
- Freshly ground black pepper

Place a 15-inch paella pan across two burners and heat over medium-high heat
until hot, about 2 minutes. Add the chorizo to the pan and cook, stirring
occasionally, until it has started to brown and the fat has rendered, about 2
to 3 minutes. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, transfer the sausage to a large
bowl; set aside.

- 8 ounces Spanish chorizo, cut into 1/4-inch-thick rounds

There should be a thin layer of rendered fat in the pan. If there’s not enough,
add 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the seasoned chicken to the pan in a
single layer and sear, stirring occasionally, until both sides are golden
brown, about 6 minutes total. (You will need to rotate the pan occasionally
over the burners to evenly distribute the heat.) Using tongs or a slotted
spoon, transfer the chicken to the bowl with the chorizo; set aside.

- Seasoned chicken
- 1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil, as needed

Reduce the heat to medium. Add the onion, season with salt and pepper, and
cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes.

- 1 medium yellow onion, small dice

Add the garlic, remaining 3/4 teaspoon paprika, and saffron, stir to combine,
and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

- 2 medium garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 3/4 teaspoon smoked Spanish paprika (pimentón dulce)
- 1 large pinch saffron threads

Add the reserved tomato pulp and juice and cook until the mixture has slightly
darkened in color, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan,
about 3 minutes.

- Reserved tomato pulp

Add the rice and measured salt and stir to coat in the tomato mixture.

- 2 cups paella rice (about 1 pound), sometimes labeled bomba or Valencia
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning the shrimp and chicken

Increase the heat to medium high. Add the broth and stir to combine.

- 4 cups (1 quart) low-sodium chicken broth

Arrange the rice mixture in an even layer. Distribute the reserved chorizo and
chicken over the rice, adding any accumulated juices from the bowl. (Do not
stir the rice from this point on.)

Bring to a lively simmer and continue to simmer, adjusting the heat as
necessary and rotating the pan 90 degrees every few minutes, until the rice
grains have swelled, most of the liquid has been absorbed, and the rice starts
to make a crackling sound, about 12 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat.

Arrange the reserved shrimp and the shellfish (hinge-side down) in the rice,
nestling them slightly. Place the pan in the oven and bake until the shellfish
have opened, the shrimp are just cooked through, and the rice is tender but
still al dente, about 10 to 12 minutes.

- 16 mussels, Manila clams, or a combination, scrubbed

Remove the pan from the oven and place on a wire rack. Cover with foil and let
stand for 5 minutes. Before serving the paella, discard any unopened shellfish
and sprinkle the dish with the parsley. Serve with the lemon wedges.

- 2 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves
- 2 medium lemons, cut into 8 wedges each, for serving
