# Chicken wings

## Sauce

Combine and simmer gently for 15 minutes:

- 1/2 cup Louisiana-style hot sauce (such as Frank's)
- 8 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 4 teaspoons white vinegar
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

This is enough sauce to coat about 2.5 pounds of wings.

## Wings

Deep fry in 375 F pure/unrefined peanut oil until lightly browned (approximately 10-12 minutes, depending on the recovery time of the oil).

Remove wings from deep fryer, allow to drip dry for 1 minute, and toss to coat in the sauce. Serve immediately.
